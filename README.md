## Things to learn for this project

üèπ System Programming

üèπ Command Line and how they are used:

The command line is an interface where users can type and execute commands to interact with the computer.
Users can run programs, navigate file systems, manage processes, and perform various tasks using the command line.
Commands are entered in a terminal or console, and they can have options and arguments.

üèπ Environment variables and local variables:

Environment variables are global variables that are accessible by all processes running on a system.
Local variables are specific to a particular shell session or script.
Examples of environment variables include PATH, HOME, and USER.

üèπ Pipe:

The pipe (|) is used to combine the output of one command as the input to another.
It allows for the creation of command pipelines, where the output of one command becomes the input for the next.

üèπ File permissions:

File permissions control access to files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.
Permissions include read (r), write (w), and execute (x) for the owner, group, and others.
chmod command is used to change file permissions.

üèπ Signals:

Signals are software interrupts that are sent to a process to notify it to perform some action.
Examples include SIGINT (interrupt), SIGTERM (terminate), and SIGKILL (forceful termination).
kill command is often used to send signals to processes.

üèπ Builtins:

        ‚úçÔ∏è echo -n: Prints text to the console without adding a newline at the end.

        ‚úçÔ∏è cd: Changes the current working directory.

        ‚úçÔ∏è pwd: Prints the current working directory.

        ‚úçÔ∏è export: Sets an environment variable.

        ‚úçÔ∏è unset: Unsets an environment variable.

        ‚úçÔ∏è env: Displays the environment variables.

        ‚úçÔ∏è exit: Exits the shell or script.


üèπ File descriptors:

File descriptors are integer values associated with open files in a Unix-like operating system.
Standard file descriptors are 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), and 2 (stderr).
Input/output redirection and pipes manipulate file descriptors.

üèπ Synchronization between processes:

Synchronization mechanisms, such as semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables, are used to coordinate and control the execution of multiple processes.
These mechanisms prevent race conditions and ensure proper communication between processes.

üí• First thing to do is to understand the projects goals and requirements, learn and practice the allowed functions and in the process you will 
develop ideas that will later on help you to develop a algorithm that will work for you. 

I have give explantions for the give functions thanks to the man page and AI..


    Functions:
üí• readline(prompt): 
    readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
    prompt as a prompt.  If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no
    prompt is issued.  The line returned is allocated with malloc(3);
    the caller must free it when finished.  The line returned has the
    final newline removed, so only the text of the line remains
  
  char *readline(const char *promt)

üí• rl_clear_history(): The rl_clear_history function is part of the GNU
      Readline library and is used to clear the entire command history maintained by Readline. When you call rl_clear_history, it removes all the entries from the history list.
    Be cautious when using rl_clear_history because it removes all history entries. This function is typically used when you want to reset the command history, for example, when restarting a new session or when a specific condition is met in your program
    
    void rl_clear_history(void)
üí• rl_on_new_line():
    rl_on_new_line is a function in the GNU Readline library used to inform Readline that the cursor has moved to a new line. This function is part of the Readline library, which provides a set of functions for handling command-line input, editing, and history.

    void rl_on_new_line(void);

üí• rl_replace_line():
    rl_replace_line is a function in the GNU Readline library used to replace the entire current input line (the line the user is currently typing) with a new string. This function is part of the Readline library, which provides a set of functions for handling command-line input, editing, and history.

    int rl_replace_line(const char *text, int clear_undo;
    parameters:
        text: The new string that will replace the current input line.
        clear_undo: If non-zero, clears the undo information.
    Return Value:
        Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
    Description:
        The rl_replace_line function replaces the entire contents of the current input line with the specified text.
    
üí• rl_redisplay():
        The rl_redisplay function forces an immediate redisplay of the current input line. This is useful when you've made changes to the line using functions like rl_replace_line, and you want to ensure that the changes are immediately visible on the terminal
    
    void    rl_redisplay(void);

    add_history(const char *string):
        The add_history function adds the specified string to the command history, making it available for retrieval and recall through the command history features provided by Readline.
    
    void add_history(const char *string);
    To retrieve the history, you need to get the history list and print it:
    
    HIST_ENTRY is the struct type and the history list retuns pointer to the commands.
    HIST_ENTRY** list = history_list();

üí• access():
        The access function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to check whether the calling process can access a file or directory.
    
    int access(const char *path, int amode);
    parameters:
        path: 
            The path to the file or directory whose accessibility is to be checked.
        amode: 
            The mode of access to be checked, specified using a combination of    symbolic constants. Common constants include:
                F_OK:   Checks for the existence of the file or directory.
                R_OK:   Checks if the file or directory is readable.
                W_OK:   Checks if the file or directory is writable.
                X_OK:   Checks if the file or directory is executable.
    The function returns 0 if the access is allowed according to the specified mode,and -1 if there is an error or if access is denied.

üí• open():
        The open function in C is part of the <fcntl.h> (File Control) header and is used to open a file or create it if it doesn't exist. It returns a file descriptor, an integer that represents the file in subsequent operations.
    
    #include <fcntl.h>

    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, ... mode_t mode );

    Parameters:
        pathname: The path to the file.
        flags: 
            A combination of flags that specify the mode of opening. Common flags include:
                O_RDONLY: Open for reading only.
                O_WRONLY: Open for writing only.
                O_RDWR: Open for reading and writing.
                O_CREAT: Create the file if it does not exist.
                O_TRUNC: Truncate the file to zero length.
        mode: 
            An optional parameter that specifies the file permissions when creating a file (used only when O_CREAT is set). You can specify the permissions using symbolic constants like S_IRUSR (read permission for the owner) or S_IWGRP (write permission for the group).

    
    .
    The function returns a file descriptor on success or -1 on failure. The file descriptor can be used in subsequent read or write operations.

üí• read():
        The read function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to read data from a file descriptor. It returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if there was an error.
    
        ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
        Parameters:
            fd: The file descriptor to read from.
            buf: The buffer to store the data read.
            count: The maximum number of bytes to read.
        The function returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if there was an error.

üí• close():

        int close(int fd);
        Parameters:
            fd: The file descriptor to close.
        The function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

üí• fork():

The fork function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to create a new process, called a child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). The child process is an exact copy of the parent process except for the following:

            The child process has a unique process ID.
            The child process has a different parent process ID (the process ID of the parent process).
            The child process has its own copy of the parent's file descriptors. These file descriptors refer to the same open file descriptions as the corresponding file descriptors in the parent.
            The child process has its own copy of the parent's environment variables.
            The child process has its own copy of the parent's working directory.
            The child process does not inherit the parent's memory locks.
            The child process does not inherit timers set by the parent.
            The child process does not inherit record locks set by the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated resource limits from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated signal masks from the parent.

            The child process does not inherit process-associated CPU-time clocks from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated I/O completion notifications from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated I/O completion queues from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated CPU affinity from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread-specific data from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation states from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation types from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation asynchronous safe cleanup handlers from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation deferred handlers from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation set IDs from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation enabled states from the parent.
            The child process does not inherit process-associated thread cancellation pending states from
        pid_t fork(void);
        
        The function returns the process ID of the child process to the parent process, and 0 to the child process. If there is an error, the function returns -1.

üí• wait():
        The wait function in C is part of the <sys/wait.h> header and is used to wait for the child process to terminate. It returns the process ID of the terminated child process, or -1 if there was an error.

        pid_t wait(int *status);

        Parameters:
            status: A pointer to an integer where the exit status of the child process will be stored.
        The wait() system call returns the process ID of the terminated child process. If there are no child processes, wait() returns -1 and sets errno to ECHILD.

        The status argument is used to store information about the terminated child process. By convention, the macro WIFEXITED(status) can be used to check whether the child terminated normally. If true, WEXITSTATUS(status) can be used to obtain the exit status of the child process.

üí• waitpid():
        The waitpid function in C is part of the <sys/wait.h> header and is used to wait for a specific child process to terminate. It returns the process ID of the terminated child process, or -1 if there was an error.

        pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);

        Parameters:
            pid: 
                The process ID of the child process to wait for. If pid is -1, waitpid() waits for any child process to terminate.
                if the pid is 0, waitpid() waits for any child process in the same process group as the calling process to terminate.
                if the pid is > 0, waitpid() waits for the child process with the specified process ID to terminate.
            status: 
                A pointer to an integer where the exit status of the child process will be stored.
            options: 
                A combination of flags that specify the behavior of waitpid(). Common flags include:
                WNOHANG: Return immediately if no child process has terminated.
                WUNTRACED: Also return if a child has stopped (but not traced via ptrace(2)). Status for traced children which have stopped is provided even if this option is not specified.
        The waitpid() system call returns the process ID of the terminated child process. If there are no child processes, waitpid() returns -1 and sets errno to ECHILD.

üí• wait3():
        This is the same as waitpid() with the options set to 0.
    wait4():
        The wait4 function is another system call for waiting on child processes in Unix-like operating systems. It is similar to waitpid but provides additional options for gathering information about child processes, such as resource usage statistics. Like waitpid, wait4 is considered more feature-rich compared to the basic wait system call.

        pid_t wait4(pid_t pid, int *status, int options, struct rusage *rusage);
        parameters:
            pid: 
                The process ID of the child process to wait for. If pid is -1, wait4() waits for any child process to terminate.
                if the pid is 0, wait4() waits for any child process in the same process group as the calling process to terminate.
                if the pid is > 0, wait4() waits for the child process with the specified process ID to terminate.
            status: 
                A pointer to an integer where the exit status of the child process will be stored.
            options: 
                A combination of flags that specify the behavior of wait4(). Common flags include:
                WNOHANG: Return immediately if no child process has terminated.
                WUNTRACED: Also return if a child has stopped (but not traced via ptrace(2)). Status for traced children which have stopped is provided even if this option is not specified.
            rusage: 
                A pointer to a struct rusage where resource usage statistics for the child process will be stored.
üí• signal():

        Parameters:
            pid: The process ID of the process to send the signal to.
            sig: The signal to send.
        The kill() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
    
üí• exit():
        The exit function in C is part of the <stdlib.h> header and is used to terminate the calling process. It does not return a value.

        void exit(int status);

        Parameters:

        The lstat() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        lstat is similar to stat but does not follow symbolic links. If pathname refers to a symbolic link, lstat returns information about the link itself, not the file it points to.
    
üí• fstat():
        The fstat function in C is part of the <sys/stat.h> header and is used to get information about a file. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        Parameters:
            pathname: The path to the file to delete.
        The unlink() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
    
üí• execve():
        The execve function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to execute a program. It does not return a value.

üí• dup():
        The dup function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to duplicate a file descriptor. It returns a new file descriptor on success and -1 on failure.

        int dup(int oldfd);

        Parameters:
            oldfd: The file descriptor to duplicate.
        The dup() function returns a new file descriptor on success and -1 on failure.
    why do we need dup()?
        The dup() function is used to duplicate a file descriptor. It is useful when you want to redirect the output of a program to a file. For example, if you want to redirect the output of a program to a file, you can use dup() to duplicate the file descriptor of the file and then use dup2() to redirect the output of the program to the file.

üí• dup2():
        The dup2 function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to duplicate a file descriptor. It returns a new file descriptor on success and -1 on failure.

        int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);

        Parameters:
            oldfd: The file descriptor to duplicate.
            newfd: The file descriptor to duplicate to.
        The dup2() function returns a new file descriptor on success and -1 on failure.
    uses of dup2():
        The dup2() function is used to duplicate a file descriptor. It is useful when you want to redirect the output of a program to a file. For example, if you want to redirect the output of a program to a file, you can use dup() to duplicate the file descriptor of the file and then use dup2() to redirect the output of the program to the file.
    
    examples of dup2():
        int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
        dup2(fd, STDOUT_FILENO);
        close(fd);
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        The above code opens a file called output.txt and redirects the output of the program to the file. The printf() function will write to the file instead of the standard output. The file descriptor of the file is duplicated using dup() and then redirected to the standard output using dup2().
    
üí• pipe():
        The pipe function in C is part of the <unistd.h> header and is used to create a pipe, a unidirectional communication channel between two processes. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        int pipe(int pipefd[2]);

        Parameters:
            pipefd: 
                An array of two integers where the file descriptors for the pipe will be stored.
        The pipe() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        uses of pipe():
            The pipe() function is used to create a pipe, a unidirectional communication channel between two processes.

        The tputs function in C is part of the <curses.h> header and is used to output a terminal capability string. It returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        int tputs(const char *str, int affcnt, int (*putc)(int));

        Parameters:
            str: The terminal capability string to output.
            affcnt: The number of lines affected by the operation.
            putc: A pointer to a function that outputs a character.
        The tputs() function returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.

        uses of tputs():
            The tputs() function is used to output a terminal capability string. It is useful when you want to access the capabilities of the terminal, such as the control sequences for cursor movement or text formatting. For example, you can use tputs() to output the terminal capability string for moving the cursor and use it to control the behavior of the terminal.

        example of tputs():
            char *cursor_up = tgetstr("up", NULL);
            if (tputs(cursor_up, 1, putchar) == -1) {
                perror("tputs");
                return EXIT_FAILURE;
            }
            The above code gets the terminal capability string for moving the cursor up and outputs it to the terminal using tputs(). The tputs() function returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure.
